# mugwump

Mugwump is a very old game that I played as a child. I thought it would make a fun exercise for
learning Clojure. My implementation could use a lot of improvement.

## Usage

You'll need to already have [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). Clone the repository, chdir to
its folder and use `lein run` to run the game.

## Notes

This was a learning exercise and should not be taking as the right way, or even a good way to do
anything. I'd like to make it handle user input errors gracefully. I'd like it to be more
idiomatic. I'd like it to be decoupled from user input so that I could actually have applied
TDD to its development beyond some ad-hoc use of the REPL.

If you are a clojure developer and care to offer any advice, I would be grateful for your feedback.
